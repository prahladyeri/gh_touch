```
gh_touch is a placeholder repository to keep your github activity going.

It contains just three files:

* run.dat		# simple text file
* run.py		# program that fills above text file with random bytes
* run.sh		# bash script that runs the above program and pushes changes upstream

To get this working, just fork and clone the repository, and add below command to your daily cron:

	cd /path/to/gh_touch/; ./run.sh

(replace /path/to/gh_touch with the actual path, of course!)
```
